# Password-Generator
## A password generator made with Java and the JavaFx library

The goal of this application is to provide the user with strong passwords. There are 4 checkboxes that the users can select to increase password security.

1. Including lowercase letters
2. Including uppercase letters
3. Including special charracters
4. Including numbers

Clicking the refresh button generates a new password with the parameters (checkboxes) provided.

There is also a copy button which copies the generated password to the clipboard, making it easy to paste it in a password text field or anywhere the user needs to.

The application's user interface (currently) looks like this
